<h1>Variables</h1>
<p id="main">
Program typically use data to perform task. Creating a <b> variables</b> reserve a memory location,
or a space in a memory, for storing values. It is called <b>variables</b> because the information stored in
that location can be changed when the program is running.<br>
To use a variable, it must first be declared by specifying the name and the data type. A variable name, 
also called <b>identifier</b>, can contain letters, number and the underscore character(_) and must start
 with a letter or underscore.<br>Although the name of the variable can be any set of letters and numbers,
the best identifier is <b>descriptive</b> of the data it will contain. This is very important in order to create 
clear, understanable and readerable code!</p>
<p id="note">
For example:<br>
<b>firtsName</b> and <b>lastName</b> are good descriptive variable names, while <b>abc</b>
 and <b>xyz</b>.<br></p>
<h1>Variable Types</h1>
<p id="main">
A <b>data type</b> defines the information that can be stored in a variable, the size of needed memory and the operations that can be 
stored in a variable,the size of needed memory and the operations tha can be performed with the variable.<br>
For Example, to store an integer value(a whole number) in a variable, use the int keyword.
<p id="eg">
int myAge;<br><br>
</p>
<p id="main">
The code above declares a variable named myAge of type integer.
</p>
<p id="note">
A line of code that completes an action is called a statement. Each statement in C# must end with a semicolon.
</p>
<p id="main">
You can assign the value of a variable when you declare it:
</p>
<p id="eg">
int myAge = 18;<br>
</p>
<p id="main">
or later in your code:
</p>
<p id="eg">
int myAge;<br>
myAge=18;<br><br>
</p>
<p id="note">
Remember that you need to declare the variable before using it.
</p>
<h1>Built-in Data Types</h1>
<p id="main">
There are a number of built-in data types in C#. The most 
common are:<br>
<a href="#int" title="integer">int</a> - integer.<br>
<a href="#float" title="float">float</a>-floating point number.<br>
<a href="#double" title="double">double</a>-double-precision version of float.<br>
<a href="#char" title="char">char</a> - a single character.<br>
<a href="#bool" title="boolean">bool</a> - Boolean that can have onluy of two values:True or False.<br>
<a href="#string" title="string">string</a> - a sequence of characters.<br><br>
The statements below use C# data types:
</p>
<p id="eg">
int x = 42;<br>
double pi = 3.14;<br>
char y = 'Z';<br>
bool isOnline = true;<br>
string firstName = "David";<br><br>
</p>
