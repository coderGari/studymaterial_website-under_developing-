<h1>Data Types</h1>
<p id="main">
C supports the following basic data types: <br>
<span style="color:#9999ff"><b>int</b></span>:<span style="color:#9999ff"><b> integer</b></span>, a whole number.<br>
<span style="color:#9999ff"><b>float</b></span>: floating point, a number with a fractional part.<br>
<span style="color:#9999ff"><b>double</b></span>: double-precision floating point value.<br>
<span style="color:#9999ff"><b>char</b></span>: single character.<br><br>
The amount of storage required for each of these types varies by platform. 
C has a built-in <span style="color:#9999ff"><b>sizeof</b></span> operator that gives the memory requirements for a particular data type.
<b>For example:</b> 
<p id="eg"><br>
#include < stdio.h ><br>

int main() {<br>
  printf("int: %d \n", <b>sizeof(int)</b>);<br>
  printf("float: %d \n", <b>sizeof(float)</b>);<br>
  printf("double: %d \n", <b>sizeof(double)</b>);<br>
  printf("char: %d \n", <b>sizeof(char)</b>);<br>
  return 0;<br>
}<br><br>
</p>
<p id="main">
The program output displays the corresponding size in 
bytes for each data type.<br>
The <span style="color:#9999ff">printf</span> statements in this program have two <b>arguments</b>.
 The first is the output <span style="color:#9999ff">string</span> with a <b>format specifier (%d)</b>, while the next <span style="color:#9999ff">argument</span> returns the <span style="color:#9999ff">sizeof </span>value. In the final output, the <b>%d</b> (for decimal) is replaced by the value in the second <b>argument</b>. 
</p>
<p id="note">
Note that C does not have a boolean type.<br>

A <b>printf</b> statement can have multiple format specifiers with corresponding arguments to replace the specifiers. Format specifiers are also referred to as conversion specifiers. 
We will learn more about format specifiers in the upcoming lessons.
</p>
<h1>Variables</h1>
<p id="main">
A variable is a name for an area in memory.<br>
The name of a variable (also called the <b>identifier</b>) must begin with either a letter or an underscore and can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore <span style="color:9999ff">character</span>. 
Variable naming conventions differ, however using lowercase letters with an underscore to separate words is common (snake_case). 
Variables must also be declared as a data type before they are used.
<br><br>
The value for a declared variable is changed with an <b>assignment statement</b>. 
For example, the following statements declare an <span style="color:#9999ff">integer</span> variable <b>my_var</b> and then assigns it the value 42: 
</p>
<p id="eg">
<b>int</b> my_var;<br>
my_var=42;<br><br>
</p>
<p id="main">
You can also declare and <b>initialize</b> (assign an initial value) a variable in a single statement: 
</p>
<p id="eg">
<b>int</b> my_var=42;<br><br>
</p>
<p id="main">
Let's define variables of different types, do a simple math operation, and output the results: 
</p>
<p id="eg">
#include < stdio.h ><br>

int main() {<br>
  int a, b;<br>
  float salary = 56.23;<br>
  char letter = 'Z';<br>
  a = 8;<br>
  b = 34;<br>
  int c = a+b;<br>

  printf("%d \n", c);<br>
  printf("%f \n", salary);<br>
  printf("%c \n", letter);<br>

  return 0;<br>
}<br><br>
</p><br>
<h1>Constants</h1>
<p id="main">
A <b>constant</b> stores a value that cannot be changed from its initial assignment. 
By using constants with meaningful names, code is easier to read and understand. 
To distinguish constants from variables, a common practice is to use uppercase identifiers.<br>

One way to define a constant is by using the const keyword in a variable declaration:
</p>
<p id="eg">
#include < stdio.h ><br>
int main() {<br>
  const double PI = 3.14;<br>
  printf("%f", PI);<br>
  return 0;<br>
}<br><br>
</p>
<p id="main">
The value of PI cannot be changed during program execution. 
For example, another assignment statement, such as PI = 3.141 will generate an error.
</p>
<p id="note">
Constants must be initialized with a value when declared.
</p>
<p id="main">
Another way to define a constant is with the <b>#define</b> preprocessor directive.
The <b>#define</b> directive uses macros for defining constant values.
<b>For example:</b>
</p>
<p id="eg">
#include < stdio.h ><br>
#define PI 3.14<br>
int main() {<br>
  printf("%f", PI);<br>
  return 0;<br>
}<br><br>
</p>
<p id="mian">
Before compilation, the preprocessor replaces every macro identifier in the code with its corresponding value from the directive. In this case, every occurrence of PI is replaced with 3.14.
The final code sent to the compiler will already have the constant values in place.<br><br>
The difference between <b>const</b> and <b>#define</b> is that the former uses memory for storage and the latter does not.
</p>
<p id="note">
Do NOT put a semicolon <span style="text-decoration:underline">character</span> at the end of <b>#define</b> statements. This is a common mistake.
We will learn more about <b>preprocessor directives</b> in the next modules.
