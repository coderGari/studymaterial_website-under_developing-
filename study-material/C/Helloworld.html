<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p id="main">
As when learning any new language, the place to start is with the classic "Hello World!" program:
</p>
<p id="eg">
#include< stdio.h ><br>
int main()<br>
{<br>
printf("Hello World!!\n");<br>
return 0;<br>
}</p>
<p id="main">
Let's break down the code to understand each line:
<b>#include</b> <span style="color: #cc33ff">< stdio.h > </span>The function used for generating output is defined in <span style="color: #cc33ff">stdio.h</span>. In order to use the <span style="color: #cc33ff">printf</span> function, we need to first include the required file, also called a header file.
<br><br><span style="color: #cc33ff">Int</span> <b>main()</b> The <b>main()</b> function is the entry point to a program. Curly brackets { } indicate the beginning and end of a function (also called a code block). The statements inside the brackets determine what the function does when executed.
<br>Here, we pass the text "Hello World!" to it. <br><br>
The \n <b>escape sequence</b> outputs a newline character. Escape sequences always begin with a backslash \. <br><br>
The <b>semicolon</b> ; indicates the end of the statement. Each statement must end with a semicolon.<br><br>

<b>return 0</b>; This statement terminates the main() function and returns the value 0 to the calling process. The number 0 generally means that our program has successfully executed. Any other number indicates that the program has failed.
