<h1>Introducing C<h1>
<p id="main">
<b>C</b> is a general-purpose programming language that has been around for nearly 50 years. 
<b>C</b> has been used to write everything from operating systems (including Windows and many others) to complex programs like the Python interpreter, Git, Oracle database, and more. 
The versatility of C is by design. It is a low-level language that relates closely to the way machines work while still being easy to learn.

<p id="note">
Understanding how computer memory works is an important aspect of the C programming language.
